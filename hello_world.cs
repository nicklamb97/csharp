What is the difference between an AI and a machine learning model?

<|assistant|>
An Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad concept referring to machines or 
software that exhibit behaviors associated with human intelligence, such as 
problem-solving, learning, and decision making.

Machine Learning (ML), on the other hand, is a subset of AI that uses 
statistical methods to enable computers to learn from data without being 
explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning models are algorithms 
that can learn patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those
patterns. So, all machine learning models are AI, but not all AI uses machine 
learning. Some forms of AI may be rule-based, genetic algorithm-based, or even 
evolution strategies.
